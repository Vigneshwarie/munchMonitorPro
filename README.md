With a user-friendly interface and robust backend, the application ensures that pet care is both efficient and effective.

### New Feature

## Description
This application allows users to create an account in the portal and create, edit, or delete pet profiles. The feed scheduler allows the user to keep track of the food and medicine. The application handles all the user requests or CRUD operations through queries and mutations using GraphQL, Node.js, and Express.js. The application uses MongoDB to store the user information and authenticate the user through the JWT token. The application's front end is developed using React JS, React-Bootstrap, and Bulma CSS and deployed on the Render platform.
